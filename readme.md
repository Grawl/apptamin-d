#Important notice
##WIP status
This theme is a fork of Apptamin A Theme and still has a WIP status, so don't download it now, it's not ready yet, it's just the same as Apptamin A.
##Plan
In the nearest future I want to replace mobile features of Apptamin A with deskop-specific features.

1. Replace mobile devices with usual PC desktop monitor and iMac
2. Replace iTunes App Store button with Mac App Store button
3. Add direct download button
4. Add Windows Store button

With these updates you can use this theme for your desktop app.


##Note
In order to install this **Apptamin D Theme**, 
you have to download the [Thematic Theme](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/thematic) 
(the Apptamin D theme is a Thematic Child Theme 
and inherits all of the functionalities), 
upload both themes to your server in the `themes` folder 
and then activate the Apptamin D Theme.

Use the Apptamin D theme files to create and modify your Apptamin theme. 

This folder has to be moved to wp-content/themes, along side the Thematic folder.

Activate your new theme just like any other WordPress theme.

#FAQ

**Q**: I installed the theme but it's not working. Why?

> **A**: Please verify that you also installed the Thematic Theme, as the Apptamin A Theme is a Thematic Child Theme (see above).

**Q**: I installed the theme and it kinda works but many things don't display. Why?

> **A**: I don't know why. But it seems that you have to go to the Appearance -> Widgets 
in the admin section before the theme displays correctly.

**Q**: I know CSS and would like to create my own awesome design. How do I do that?

> **A**: You can either create your own yourstyles.css file (and modify styles.css so it uses it)
or modify one of the 2 examples we provided (yourstyles-example1.css or yourstyles-example2.css)

**Q**: How can I change the favicon (the icon in the browser title bar)?

> **A**: Create your own image, favicon.png for example, rename it favicon.ico and replace the one 
that is currently in the images/ folder.

**Q**: How to create multiple pages for showcasing my apps?

> **A**: I don't know, and that's one of the reason the project is on GitHub:
so people better at coding than me can improve the theme.
So far, the best workaround is to use the multi-site property of Wordpress
to create a website per app, then using subdomains that link one to another.

Any other questions or feedback, let us know!
