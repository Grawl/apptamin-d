#Apptamin D
###Wordpress Theme for **D**esktop applications

For promoting any desktop application with brand new website.

---
#Important notice
##WIP status
This theme is a fork of Apptamin A Theme and still has a WIP status, so don't download it now, it's not ready yet, it's just the same as Apptamin A.
##Plan
In the nearest future I want to replace mobile features of Apptamin A with deskop-specific features.

1. Replace mobile devices with usual PC desktop monitor and iMac
2. ~~Replace iTunes App Store button with Mac App Store button and Google Play with Windows Store~~
3. Add direct download button

With these updates you can use this theme for your desktop app.


##Note
In order to install this **Apptamin D Theme**, 
you have to download the [Thematic Theme](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/thematic) 
(the Apptamin D theme is a Thematic Child Theme 
and inherits all of the functionalities), 
upload both themes to your server in the `themes` folder 
and then activate the Apptamin D Theme.

Use the Apptamin D theme files to create and modify your Apptamin theme. 

This folder has to be moved to wp-content/themes, along side the Thematic folder.

Activate your new theme just like any other WordPress theme.

#FAQ

**Q**: I installed the theme but it's not working. Why?

> **A**: Please verify that you also installed the Thematic Theme, as the Apptamin D Theme is a Thematic Child Theme (see above).

**Q**: I installed the theme and it kinda works but many things don't display. Why?

> **A**: I don't know why. But it seems that you have to go to the Appearance → Widgets 
in the admin section before the theme displays correctly.

**Q**: I know CSS and would like to create my own awesome design. How do I do that?

> **A**: Use custom.css in theme folder.

**Q**: How can I change the favicon (the icon in the browser title bar)?

> **A**: Create your own image in ICO format and replace images/favicon.ico. If you want to use PNG format or specify large icon for Apple devices, you need to write meta tags to header.php or use WordPress plugin for that ([All In One Favicon](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-favicon/), for example).

**Q**: How to create multiple pages for showcasing my apps?

> **A**: I don't know, and that's one of the reason the project is on GitHub: so people better at coding than me can improve the theme. So far, the best workaround is to use the multi-site property of Wordpress to create a website per app, then using subdomains or subfolders that link one to another.
